# CSCI-241
The repository includes codes(mainly projects) I wrote for the data structure course in spring 2020. I just want to store them for future uses.
In the course, we are required to write "writeup"s that analyze the performance of our implementation and explain our tests cases. The performances can be found easily on google. The tests cases are self-explanatory. Therefore, the writeups are redundant and pretty much useless for future references. That's why I do not include them here.
Be advised: my project 1&3 are not perfect. In fact, I made critical mistake in "delimiter_check.py" in project 3. The other codes should be correct.
Please star and watch my repository.
